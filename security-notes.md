# Security Notes

Analogy:
A hotel contains many rooms (resources). If you check-in to a hotel you go to the receptionist (authorization server). This person checks with the hotel manager (resource owner) if you are allowed to access a room.
If your are allowed two variants are possible:
- you get a voucher (code) and then go to another desk to receive the room card (token)
- you get the room card directly

The room card is valid as long as you have paid the room. If it gets stolen then another person might access the room.

For B2B requests it would be to stressful to ask the hotel manager each time so the authorization server will directly hand out a token.
